    "### 2.2 Key Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Assumptions**\n",
    "1. **Market Efficiency**: Price changes reflect available information with some delay\n",
    "2. **Event Impact**: Major geopolitical events have measurable impact on oil prices\n",
    "3. **Change Point Model**: Brent oil prices follow a piecewise constant mean model with occasional structural breaks\n",
    "4. **Data Quality**: Historical price data is accurate and representative\n",
    "5. **Event Classification**: Selected events represent the most significant market drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Limitations**\n",
    "1. **Correlation vs. Causation**: \n",
    "   - **Critical Distinction**: Statistical correlation between events and price changes does NOT prove causation\n",
    "   - **Confounding Factors**: Multiple events may occur simultaneously, making attribution difficult\n",
    "   - **Market Complexity**: Oil prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond our event dataset\n",
    "   - **Temporal Alignment**: Event timing may not perfectly align with market reaction timing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Change point models assume discrete breaks rather than gradual transitions\n",
    "   - Model may miss subtle or gradual changes\n",
    "   - Prior distribution choices can influence results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Historical data may not predict future patterns\n",
    "   - Market structure changes over time\n",
    "   - Event impact may vary based on market conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Selection Bias**:\n",
    "   - Event selection based on known historical significance\n",
    "   - May miss unexpected or lesser-known influential events\n",
    "   - Hindsight bias in event categorization"

    "\n",
    "**Change point models** identify points in time where statistical properties of a time series change abruptly. For oil price analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Purposes:**\n",
    "- **Structural Break Detection**: Identify when oil price behavior fundamentally changes\n",
    "- **Regime Identification**: Discover different market regimes with distinct characteristics\n",
    "- **Event Impact Quantification**: Measure how external events alter price dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Expected Outputs:**\n",
    "1. **Change Point Locations (œÑ)**: Specific dates when structural breaks occur\n",
    "2. **Parameter Values by Regime**: Mean levels, volatility, and trends in each period\n",
    "3. **Regime Probabilities**: Confidence in regime assignments\n",
    "4. **Model Diagnostics**: Convergence and fit quality metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model Limitations:**\n",
    "- Assumes discrete breaks rather than gradual transitions\n",
    "- May miss subtle changes\n",
    "- Prior distribution choices influence results\n",
    "- **Correlation ‚â† Causation**: Statistical association doesn't prove causal impact"
